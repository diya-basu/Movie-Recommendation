# Movie-Recommendation

As the name suggests this movie recommendation software is the core code behind your Netflix’s “Top Picks for You”. Utilising machine learning concepts and effective data processing this movie recommendation software takes in input from the user about a movie they have recently watched and returns 10 similar movie picks based on a set of feature selections: namely cast, genre, director and overall ratings. It uses the Cosine similarity AI concept, which is used to derive similarities between text documents. Coded in Python using the scikit-learn module this project at its core has its implementations in and across all service based companies and websites. 

# Working 

To execute the following code: just copy and paste the code into a file in your workspace with the .py extension. 
Install neccessary modules with the following command: 
```
pip install pandas sklearn
```

# Conclusion:
It is always important to understand how certain subsets of technology while seemingly deceptively simple, have their deep-rooted applications in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This just recreates the backend framework behind any OTT platform's "Top Picks for You"/"You Might also Like".
