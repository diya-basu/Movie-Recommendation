# Movie-Recommendation

As the name suggests this movie recommendation software is the core code behind your Netflix’s “Top Picks for You”. Utilising machine learning concepts and effective data processing this movie recommendation software takes in input from the user about a movie they have recently watched and returns 10 similar movie picks based on a set of feature selections: namely cast, genre, director and overall ratings. It uses the Cosine similarity AI concept, which is used to derive similarities between text documents. Coded in Python using the scikit-learn module this project at its core has its implementations in and across all service based companies and websites.
